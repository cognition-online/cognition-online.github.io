                    <div class="blog_post_text">
                        &emsp;The Cognitive Functions theory is a general psychological framework describing how people process information and make decisions. It was originally developed by Carl Jung, and has subsequently been further explored by generations of psychologists and enthusiasts.
                        &emsp;This post is not meant to be a perfect or complete description of the cognitive functions. I am an enthusiast, not a trained psychologist. What I offer is my own understanding, based on the reading I've done and what I've observed in the people who I've typed. I hope that it can serve as an effective reference for your understanding.


                        <ins><b>What the Cognitive Functions Are NOT</b></ins>

                        &emsp;The Cognitive Functions Theory is a predecessor to the much more widely known Myers-Briggs personality test and type system. They are similar in that they use most of the same terminology and describe the same 16 personality types. They are fundamentally different in that the Myers-Briggs types describe a set of <i>easy-to-measure traits</i>, which can change in a person over time, while the Cognitive Functions Theory describes a <i>general way of processing information</i>, which rarely, if ever, changes in a person, but which a person can learn to use better over time.
                        &emsp;This distinction addresses one of the most common complaints about personality typing systems: Many people dislike the idea of being "put into a box". Every person is unique, they argue, so it's futile, and even harmful, to try to categorize them. The Cognitive Functions Theory circumvents this by allowing a high degree of variation in the details while the underlying system remains the same. For example, two ENTJs may both be very hard-working and ambitious individuals, but one maintains a stable and social job as a lawyer, and the other pursues a more solitary and variable income through trading stocks. Different levels of development are also a factor. To pick on my own personality type, INTJs generally have a problem with being defensive around their ideas, but how this manifests depends on their level of maturity. On the extreme low end, they (we) may become very angry when their ideas are questioned, viewing it as a personal attack. On the higher end, they have learned to see criticisms as a necessary and valuable - if slightly painful - source of information which helps them improve their knowledge. The cognitive functions are thus not a "box" which you are squeezed into, but engine of your car which will take you just about anywhere you like if you learn how to use it.


                        <ins><b>Terminology Overview</b></ins>

                        &emsp;There are eight cognitive functions in total. The terminology is a little confusing; Another way of describing it is that there are four functions, and two "attitudes" each function can have, which is what gives us eight functions in total. I will describe the base functions first, then the attitudes, and then what each of the eight functions does.

                        <b>The Judging Functions</b>

                        &emsp;These are the functions which a person uses to make value judgments.
                        &emsp;The <ins>Feeling</ins> function makes judgments based on moral or emotional values. It cares most of all about how people feel about things. These are the functions I understand the least, and therefore the most prone to erroneous information in this post. I will do my best, but as with all things, don't simply take me at my word for everything.
                        &emsp;The <ins>Thinking</ins> function makes judgments based on reason. It cares most of all about whether something works in an objective, impersonal way.

                        <b>The Perceiving Functions</b>

                        &emsp;These are the functions which a person uses to acquire, store, and explore information.
                        &emsp;The <ins>Sensing</ins> function handles grounded, sensory information, and discrete facts.
                        &emsp;The <ins>Intuition</ins> function handles the connections between discrete points of data, finding connections and abstract patterns.

                        <b>The Attitudes</b>

                        &emsp;Each cognitive function has an <ins>attitude</ins>, which is the "direction" it faces.
                        &emsp;<ins>Extroverted</ins> functions face outward, dealing with the world and other people.
                        &emsp;<ins>Introverted</ins> functions face inward, dealing with the person's own thoughts and feelings.
                        &emsp;Keep in mind that the attitudes describe whether a <i>function</i> is introverted or extroverted, not whether a <i>person</i> is introverted or extroverted. There is a correlation with a person's dominant function attitude and whether they are the kind of person who is an "introverted" or "extroverted" personality in the common sense of the terms, but it's not a very reliable correlation.

                        <b>Function Shorthands</b>
                        &emsp;The full name of each function, when put together with its attitude, are phrases like "introverted intuition" and "extroverted feeling". This is a bit of a mouthful to say all the time and quite cumbersome to write, so it's common to see a two-letter abbreviation for each function. This uses the first letter of each function, capitalized, except for "intuition", for which we use "N" so it doesn't get confused with introversion. Then it uses the first letter of the attitude in lower case. Thus, "introverted intuition" becomes "<ins>Ni</ins>", and "extroverted feeling" becomes "<ins>Fe</ins>".
                        &emsp;Yes, most of them happen to also be abbreviations for elements on the periodic table.


                        <ins><b>The Eight Functions</b></ins>
                        <br>
                        <b>Extroverted Feeling (Fe)</b>
                        &emsp;Fe generally describes one's awareness of other people, especially how they're feeling. High Fe use typically produces people who are highly empathetic and who strongly value social harmony, but it can also be used for manipulation. Low Fe use can make someone awkward, or even callous.

                        <b>Introverted Feeling (Fi)</b>
                        &emsp;Fi generally describes awareness of their own emotions. High Fi use gives people a strong personal identity and a set of values they're willing to fight the world to uphold, but it can also make them uncompromising and generally difficult to work with. Low Fi use can make someone dismissive of personal feelings and give them difficulty with understanding their own emotions.

                        <b>Extroverted Thinking (Te)</b>
                        &emsp;Te cares about whether something works or not, practically speaking. The objective reality of the outside world is its ultimate judge. Because it cares about efficiency and effectiveness, high Te use is very productive, but it can be callous and insensitive.

                        <b>Introverted Thinking (Ti)</b>
                        &emsp;Ti cares about whether something is consistent, logically speaking. Valid reasoning is its ultimate judge. High Ti users can be remarkably intelligent in their capacity to compute, predict, and critique, but they often take issue with the capricious nature of personal feelings.

                        <b>Extroverted Sensing (Se)</b>
                        &emsp;Se lives in the moment. It likes to do things and experience the world. It's often described as a person's literal sensory perception, and while I think this is true, its nature goes beyond that into a value of living in the now. High Se users tend to be adventurous and impulsive, pushing limits to dangerous degrees at the very high end.

                        <b>Introverted Sensing (Si)</b>
                        &emsp;Si remembers the past. It likes stability and the familiar. It stores great libraries of discrete, individual facts. It is, incidentally, the most preferred cognitive function across the human race, from the numbers we have available. Si represents a very simple and reliable strategy: When you encounter a problem, try to remember if you've solved a problem like this before (or heard about someone else who did), and then do whatever that solution was. It can be conservative to a fault, but it's popular because it's fairly reliable.

                        <b>Extroverted Intuition (Ne)</b>
                        &emsp;Ne is all about connecting ideas. It takes a set of data points, and then finds ways that you can get from one to another in highly abstract chains. Ne loves possibility; It likes to take one starting point and then find all the ways things can branch out from there. While <i>highly</i> creative and inventive, Ne can have a hard time staying focused or making a commitment.

                        <b>Introverted Intuition (Ni)</b>
                        &emsp;Ni is all about finding the essence of things, the underlying principles which unify everything. It is the <i>least</i> preferred cognitive function across the human race, probably because it's very difficult to do well and finding practical uses for what it discovers can be difficult. Ni loves unity; It likes to take a huge set of seemingly unrelated data points and find the common thread that explains them all. The insights Ni can discover often feel magical in their brilliance, but frequently, Ni ends up with tunnel vision and gives bad conclusions instead.


                        <ins><b>The Function Stack</b></ins>

                        &emsp;Every human being uses all eight functions. What differs is the order of preference and comfortability. Functions are described as being arranged in a linear hierarchy, called a person's <ins>function stack</ins>. The top four functions are the <ins>main stack</ins>, and describe the functions a person values (especially the top two). The <ins>shadow stack</ins> is the name for the lower four functions, and describes the things a person is going to have a naturally more antagonistic relationship with. It is important to remember that while function stacks seem to change rarely, if at all, throughout a person's lifetime, a person's relationship with each of their functions can mature (or degrade) without changing the ordering.

                        <b>1. Dominant:</b> The first function in a stack is called a person's "dominant", or sometimes "hero" function. This is something which is so easy and comfortable for them to use that they can basically do it forever with little risk of exhaustion. It's a person's main focus, their joy and purpose, and maybe just a bit overbearing.

                        <b>2. Auxiliary:</b> The second function is called the "auxiliary" function, or sometimes the "parent" function. The "parent" name comes from its supporting and nurturing role. What the dominant function wants to do, goes through the auxiliary for implementation. People are fairly comfortable using their auxiliary functions but won't find as much satisfaction from it as thier dominant.

                        <b>3. Tertiary:</b> The third function is called "tertiary", or the "child" function. Here we enter the territory of discomfort. A "child" function is a natural sensitive point for a person, something they may cherish but are not very good at. In my experience, tertiary functions tend to get a bit out of control as a person dotes upon them. The tertiary Si of INFPs makes them want to hide in their comfy space even when they have things to do, and the tertiary Se of ENTJ and ENFJ makes them perpetually busy and sometimes hedonistic. Development of this function is important, but it usually happens naturally starting around a person's early 20s.

                        <b>4. Inferior:</b> The fourth function is a painful and anxiety-inducing weak point. Developing it is very important to a person's happiness, but it can take a long time to start, and I'm not sure it always happens. It will never be as fully developed as someone who has this function as their dominant or auxiliary, but it's important to work with it even though it makes you anxious.

                        <b>5. Nemesis:</b> Here we begin on the shadow stack, and a series of more poetic names. Each shadow stack function is the same as its corresponding main stack function, but with inverted attitude (more on stack ordering below). The nemesis thus opposes the dominant function. An unhealthy person will regard the nemesis as an enemy. A more mature person will recognize that it has valuable lessons to teach, and can even turn it into a dynamic friendship. While a person may not have the best relationship with their nemesis function within themselves, they often get along well with other people who have it as their 1st or 2nd function.

                        <b>6. Critical Parent:</b> The 6th function is a person's internal critic, especially regarding their auxiliary or "parent" function. Worse, it's a function people may use to attack others. Proper integration of the "critical parent" is difficult and not something I understand very well, but I think there is a useful starting position in that people do seem to respect this function to some degree, otherwise its critiques wouldn't warrant listening to.

                        <b>7. Trickster:</b> The last two functions are highly negative for a person. The trickster is the inverse of the child, a weak point which can feel like it deceives and attacks one's precious child. In my own experience, simply understanding the trickster function in a neutral rather than negative light can be a challenge. If you do not make that effort, you may end up in hostility towards people with this function high in their stack.

                        <b>8. Demon:</b> The bottom of the barrel. The 8th function is so far from your natural mode of thinking that it's almost alien. Trying to use it is highly uncomfortable and antithetical to a person's purpose. Unfortunately I don't know what you're supposed to do with it, other than to not actually demonize it and respect that it does have a good reason to exist.


                        <ins><b>Function Axes and Stack Ordering</b></ins>

                        &emsp;Cognitive functions follow a few rules in how they're arranged in a stack.
                        &emsp;<b>Rule 1:</b> In the top two functions, there is one Judging function, and one Perceiving function.
                        &emsp;<b>Rule 2:</b> In the top two functions, there is one Introverted function, and one Extroverted function.
                        &emsp;<b>Rule 3:</b> The 3rd function is the other end of the 2nd function's axis (explained below), and the 4th function is the other end of the 1st function's axis.
                        &emsp;<b>Rule 4:</b> Functions 5 through 8 are the same as functions 1 through 4 but with inverted attitudes.
                        &emsp;Put together, there are 16 valid stack combinations, which is also why there are 16 personality types in the Myers-Briggs type system.

                        &emsp;Certain functions always come as a pair in either the main stack or the shadow stack. They work together in a way. It seems to me that they represent two ends of one process.
                        &emsp;<b>The Te-Fi Axis:</b> Extroverted Thinking and Introverted Feeling are always paired. Despite having this axis in my main stack, I don't understand its dynamic very well.
                        &emsp;<b>The Fe-Ti Axis:</b> Extroverted Feeling and Introverted Thinking are always paired. Where Fe maintains awareness of other people, Ti checks for consistency, including consistent behavior. This can provide them great insight into how other people think, at once focused on what the other person is expressing and building a mental model of them in their own head. When more negative, it can become a social game of trying to guess what the other person is really thinking. At least, I dislike that game; A lot of people seem to find it quite fun and play it consensually.
                        &emsp;<b>The Ne-Si Axis:</b> Extroverted Intuition and Introverted Sensing are always paired. The dynamic here is fairly straightforward: Si stores data in large sets of discrete points, and Ne finds connections between those points. You can think of it a bit like Ne does a database search based on some kind of tag. Perhaps the dishwasher is broken, so Ne asks Si, "Who are all the people and other resouces we know which have something to do with dishashers or fixing appliances?" And then Si returns a complete list of everyone and everything it has on file matching that criteria, even if it's a bit out in the weeds.
                        &emsp;<b>The Se-Ni Axis:</b> Extroverted Sensing and Introverted Intuition are always paired. This axis is hard to understand, but it seems to have to do with pathfinding. The benefit of Ni universal principles is that, if they actually work, they can be used anywhere, including uncharted territory. You can think of it like a compass, which continues to tell you orientation even if you're in a completely unfamiliar land. This is quite useful if you're pushing boundaries as Se does. Ni also works in a fairly subconscious way, allowing it to be used without thinking while you're engaging in some Se activity which doesn't give you the time to pull up old memories for comparison. This is my own theory though, and I don't think this is a very complete understanding of how the Se-Ni axis works.


                        <ins><b>The 16 Types and the Myers-Briggs Acronyms</b></ins>

                        &emsp;An in-depth description of each function stack is beyond the scope of this post, so I will mostly be talking here about how the acronyms you've probably seen before correspond to a function stack. There is a logic to it, but it's somewhat convoluted. We'll use INTJ as an example.

                        &emsp;<b>Step 1:</b> Look at the middle two letters. These are the top two functions, using the same lettering system as function abbreviations. For INTJ, this is iNtuition and Thinking. But we don't know the attitudes or the order yet.
                        &emsp;<b>Step 2:</b> Look at the fourth letter. This is the weird one; It tells you <i>which top function is the extroverted one</i>. For INTJs, their Judging function is extroverted, which for them is Thinking. Using Rule 2 from above, we know that their iNtuition function must be introverted.
                        &emsp;<b>Step 3:</b> Look at the first letter. This tells you which top function is dominant. For INTJ, that's that's their introverted function, in this case, Ni. So an INTJ's dominant function is Ni, and their auxiliary function is Te.
                        &emsp;<b>Step 4:</b> Follow the rules from above to determine the rest of the stack. Rule 3 says the tertiary function is the other end of the auxiliary function's axis. The other end of Te is Fi, so an INTJ's 3rd function is introverted feeling. Following for the 4th and 1st functions, an INTJ's 4th function is Se. So their main stack is Ni-Te-Fi-Se.
                        &emsp;<b>Stpe 5:</b> Follow rule 4 to invert the main stack and get the shadow functions. For an INTJ, their shadow stack is Ne-Ti-Fe-Si (which happens to also be the ENTP main stack). If you wanted to write out the full 8 function INTJ stack, it would be Ni-Te-Fi-Se-Ne-Ti-Fe-Si, but basically no one writes it all out like this.

                        &emsp;It that seems weirdly hard to work with, that's because it is. The Myers-Briggs acronyms were designed mainly to describe a set of personality <i>traits</i>, such as whether a person likes to spend more time alone or socializing. Socionics is another offshoot of the Cognitive Functions Theory which has a couple of its own acronym systems, which are both easier to use than Myers-Briggs. Unfortunately, the Myers-Briggs system is what everyone uses, and it's not enough of a problem to bother with the monumental task of trying to fix it.
                        &emsp;For your convenience, here's a list of all 16 types and their main stack configurations:
                        &emsp;<b>INTJ:</b> Ni-Te-Fi-Se
                        &emsp;<b>ENTJ:</b> Te-Ni-Se-Fi
                        &emsp;<b>INFJ:</b> Ni-Fe-Ti-Se
                        &emsp;<b>ENFJ:</b> Fe-Ni-Se-Ti
                        &emsp;<b>INTP:</b> Ti-Ne-Si-Fe
                        &emsp;<b>ENTP:</b> Ne-Ti-Fe-Si
                        &emsp;<b>INFP:</b> Fi-Ne-Si-Te
                        &emsp;<b>ENFP:</b> Ne-Fi-Te-Si
